        <h3>1. Drink 3 water bottles everyday💦</h3>
        <p>Getting enough water every day is important for your health. 
            Drinking water can prevent dehydration, a condition that can cause unclear thinking, result in mood change, 
            cause your body to overheat, and lead to constipation and kidney stones.</p>

        <h3>2. Workout atleast 2 times a week💪🏼</h3>
        <p>Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, 
            strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities. 
            Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits.</p>

        <h3>3. Eat healthy food (according to the Food Pyramid Guide)🥗</h5>
        <p>By consuming foods from all levels in the pyramid, we get all the important nutrients our bodies need. 
            For example, dairy products can help provide calcium to support bone health, and consuming enough 
            fruits and vegetables will supply vitamin C to support a healthy immune system. 
            Plus, eating healthy protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. 
            Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>

        <h3>5. Go outside🍃</h3>
        <p>Going out especially to parks and nature can help decrease your anxiety levels and can help lessen stress and feelings of anger. 
            Exercise can also help this, but it's even better when you're outside. 
            Regular access to green spaces has been linked to lower risks of depression and improved concentration and attention.</p>
